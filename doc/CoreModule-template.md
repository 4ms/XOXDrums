# CoreModule Template

This is a template project for creating a plugin of CoreModules, and 
compiling it as a MetaModule plugin and a VCV Rack plugin.

## Prerequisites
To build, make sure you set RACK_DIR to point to the Rack SDK on your computer.
You will also need all the prerequisites required to build Rack. Read how here:
https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial#Prerequisites

The MetaModule SDK is already a submodule of this repo, but you can use a
different MetaModule SDK if you wish (see below).

You also need the following in order to build the MetaModule plugin:
- cmake v3.24 or later
- ninja (not required if you configure cmake to use a different generator)
- arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain 12.2 or 12.3, installed on your PATH
- python 3.6 or later


Make sure to clone the submodules recursively:

```
git clone https://github.com/4ms/coremodule-template.git
cd coremodule-template
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building

To build just the MetaModule plugin:
```
make mm
```

To build just the Rack plugin:
```
make all
```

To build both plugins:
```
make all mm
```

To package and install the Rack plugin:
```
make install
```

To install the MetaModule plugin, copy the file in `metamodule-plugins/` that
ends in `.mmplugin` to the `metamodule-plugins/` folder on an SD Card or USB
drive. You can do this in your OS, or use the command-line:

```
cp metamodule-plugins/*.mmplugin /Volumes/MyUsbDrive/metamodule-plugins/    # For example
```

To clean the build for both plugins:
```
make clean
```

To re-configure the MetaModule plugin cmake build:
```
make config
```


Edit the Makefile and set the BRAND_SLUG to be the actual brand slug that's used in VCV and MetaModule. This gets
used to create the correct path to the PNG files for the MetaModule plugin.

Once you have the BRAND_SLUG set, and you've created your info SVGs (see below), 
you can generate all PNG, SVG and info headers with this command:

```
make update-images
```

Also run the above command any time you change the info SVG files.



## Adding or editing a module

Each module has two classes: the core class (DSP features) and the info class (GUI features).

The core class is found in src/modules/. For example, `src/modules/MyModule.hh`.

The info class is found in src/modules/info/, for example `src/modules/info/MyModule_info.hh`.

The info class file is generated from an SVG file using the
svgextract python script (see below). These SVG files live in
`module-svg/MyModule_info.svg`.

When you add a new module, you'll also need to add it to the init() functions in plugin-vcv.cc and plugin-mm.cc.
Copy the examples, and make sure to `#include` the core .hh file.

You also need to edit to add a new module is in plugin.json and plugin-mm.json.

And finally, the faceplate and component artwork needs to be present for both projects.

In summary, here are all the places where a new module needs to be added:
- Create `src/modules/NewModule.hh` to define your module's core
- Create `module-svg/NewModule_info.svg` to define how the module looks and the names of the components
- Run `make update-images` to generate `src/modules/info/NewModule_info.hh`, and `assets/NewModule.png` and `res/NewModule.svg`
- Add an `#include` and `register_module()` to `src/plugin-mm.cc`
- Add an `#include`, a `GenericModule<...>::create()` and a `p->addModel();` to `src/plugin-vcv.cc`
- Add an entry to plugin.json
- Add an entry to plugin-mm.json


## Workflow

If you need to adjust a control, or XY position of something, you should make the change in the info.svg file. Then run `make update-images`
to re-generate the info.hh, png, and vcv svg files. 
This will keep everything in sync, and avoid lots of issues. 

If you have a special situation and you don't want to update all three things
at once, then (say, for instance if you made custom PNG files that look good at
low-res), then you can issue separate commands to do the re-generating:


Re-generate just the VCV SVG:
```bash
make res/ModuleName.svg
```

Re-generate just the MetaModule PNG:
```bash
make assets/ModuleName.png
```


Re-generate just the info header file:
```bash
make src/modules/info/ModuleName_info.hh
```

If you are curious, take a look at the scripts/ dir, and/or the Makefile to see what commands those run.


## Using a different MetaModule SDK

To use a different version of the SDK, you have some options.

One way is to checkout a different branch in the SDK submodule:

```bash
cd metamodule-plugin-sdk
git checkout v2.0-dev                 # For example, to checkout the v2.0-dev branch
git submodule update --recursive
cd ..
```

Another option is to use a cmake variable to point to the SDK you want to use on your computer:

```bash
make config METAMODULE_SDK_DIR=/full/path/to/metamodule-plugin-sdk
```

You can also specify where the .mmplugin file goes like this:

```bash
make config METAMODULE_SDK_DIR=/path/SDK-v2/metamodule-plugin-sdk MM_INSTALL_DIR=metamodule-plugins-v2
make mm

make config METAMODULE_SDK_DIR=/path/SDK-v1/metamodule-plugin-sdk MM_INSTALL_DIR=metamodule-plugins-v1
make mm
```

Note that the MM_INSTALL_DIR is relative to the build/ dir, so if you did the
above commands, you'd see the plugins in build/:

```bash
ls -l build

    ...
    drwxr-xr-x   3 user  group       96 Mar 20 11:49 metamodule-plugins-v1/
    drwxr-xr-x   3 user  group       96 Mar 20 11:49 metamodule-plugins-v2/
    ...

ls -l build/metamodule-plugins-v1/

    -rw-r--r--  1 user  group  26624 Mar 20 11:49 MyPlugin.mmplugin

ls -l build/metamodule-plugins-v2/

    -rw-r--r--  1 user  group  26600 Mar 20 11:49 MyPlugin.mmplugin
```

## Creating an info file

The `info` file is a header file that contains a description of all the elements in a module (jacks, knobs, switches, etc).
It also provides the module slug, faceplate location, and bypass routes.

By convention, info headers are named `Slug_info.hh` where Slug is the module slug.

In this repo, the info file(s) are in `src/modules/info/`

While you can write this by hand, getting the XY positions to match the artwork file is tedious. So, there's a script that
does this automatically.

First, create an SVG file for your modules.

Create two layers (Illustrator) or "groups" (Inkscape). One is named "components" and the other is named "faceplate".

Draw all artwork in the "faceplate" layer. If you use fonts, convert them to outlines.

In the components layer, make various shapes to indicate the location and type of each kind of element.

Read the file [scripts/info-svg-specs.md](../scripts/info-svg-specs.md) for instructions on how to to do that.

Very important is to read the part about the slug and modulename text objects.
You must have two text objects (not converted to outlines) on the components
layer (don't worry, they won't show up on your artwork!). The slug object is the module slug,
and the modulename object is a longer description.

When you have the SVG file you can run a command to automatically generate the VCV artwork SVG, the MetaModule artwork PNG, and the info header file:

```bash
make update-images
```

This will scan the `module-svg/` dir for any updated or new files and generate the following:
 
 - Generate `src/modules/info/Module_info.hh`  
 - Generate `res/Module.hh`
 - Generate `assets/Module.png`


### Details of the info file

You can regenerate just the info header file if need to with this:

```bash
scripts/createinfo.py --input module-svg/MyModule_info.svg --outdir src/modules/info/ --brand MyBrandName
```

This will create a file named `MyModule_info.hh` in src/modules/info

The text `MyBrandName` in the command above gets used as the path to the PNG file. This should match the brand slug of your plugin.

Open this file and look at the paths to the faceplate files (svg_filename and png_filename).

svg_filename is the VCV rack panel artwork. This will be something like `res/panel.svg`. 

png_filename is the MetaModule artwork. This must start with your brand slug
(which is why you enter your brand slug into the command above), that is, the
plugin name (`MyPlugin/panel.svg`).

Keep in mind that when the plugin is loaded into MetaModule, it will unpack
everything in assets/ into a directory with the name of your brand slug. So if
you have a file called `assets/knobs/ABCD.png` then it will be preset at
`MyBrandSlug/knobs/ABCD.png`.



### Using custom knobs, jacks, buttons, etc.
